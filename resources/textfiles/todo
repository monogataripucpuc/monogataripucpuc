Filter
- Black Hanekawa is filtered out by the Black Hanekawa filter.
- Having Tsubasa for one and Black Hanekawa for another is a bit confusing. Maybe Tsubasa Hanekawa and Black Hanekawa?
- Can't choose two filters from the same category
- make it so that "S" filter doesnt include "SS" while at the same time still include "S-"
- Don't quiet like how the filters are presented, the scroll-bar esspecially is kind of irritating
- Pick some better colors for the Buttons

Table
- Search-Field should be moved to the left and "Show ... entries" to the bottom left (below the table)
- clicking on the "+" should open the dialog, on the live-site that's a neat feature which is worth keeping, i think
- Sorting by Tier has to be SS -> S -> A -> B -> C -> D

General
- Not a fan of the background, at least not for the main-menu
- Instead of using a label use the place-holder attribute
